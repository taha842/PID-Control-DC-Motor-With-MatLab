# PID-Control-DC-Motor-With-MatLab
This project focuses on the design and implementation of PID voltage control for DC motor. DC motor is a machine that widely used due to excellence speed control for acceleration and deceleration with effective and simple torque control. The PID controller is employed to control the output voltage of a DC motor.
